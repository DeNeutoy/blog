# Hi, I'm Mark.

I'm a computer scientist interested in research, natural language processing and data visualisation, with a particular focus on NLP systems that work in real life. 

## Things i've worked on

* **[AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/)**, a library for Natural Language Processing research, focused on neural networks. 


* **[ScispaCy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/)** is a [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) pipeline for processing English Biomedical text. It contains models for custom tokenisation, POS Tagging, NER, Entity Linking and Syntactic Parsing. Scispacy is open source and freely available, with a public demo.

* **[Autocat](https://autocat.apps.allenai.org/)** is a small web app for training SpaCy text classifiers and interacting with them in real time.

## What i'm doing now

Right now, i'm taking a break. But soon, i'll be building a company at the Allen Institute for AI's new [incubator program](https://incubator.allenai.org/).
