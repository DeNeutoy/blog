# Hi, I'm [Mark](http://markneumann.xyz/).

I'm a computer scientist interested in research, natural language processing and data visualisation, with a particular focus on NLP systems that work in real life. I've worked on stuff like **[AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/)**, a library for Natural Language Processing research, focused on neural networks; **[ScispaCy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/)** a [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) pipeline for processing English Biomedical text, and **[Autocat](https://autocat.apps.allenai.org/)**, a small web app for training SpaCy text classifiers and interacting with them in real time. Right now, i'm taking a break. But soon, i'll be building a company at the Allen Institute for AI's new [incubator program](https://incubator.allenai.org/).
